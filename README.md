# Salmon Boilerplate (Non-Gulp)


This boilerplate is Justine Win's custom version of Devtip's Starter Kit V2.

Salmon v2 uses HTML5 & CSS3 (Non-gulp) and includes clean flex layout classes, optional bootstrap & skeleton grid, and what-not.

If you're into Jade, Sass, nor Gulp, try this [one](https://github.com/JustineWin/Salmon-Gulp).

##Grids

Choose whether you want to use bootstrap's or skeleton's grid then go to index.html and comment out the grid's css file you will not use in the `<head>` tag

##Flex layout

This page is using flex classes. I have included helpful comments on the helper.css file. Go ahead, experiment!

##Getting started


### Download ZIP file
Download the zip file then start editing your index.html and main.css file. 

### Clone

I do not recommend cloning yet, there seems to be an error regarding the gulpfile. Will look into this. 

## Structure
This version uses a very simple and common structure of files. All your CSS, JS, and IMG can be found in your Assets folder.
